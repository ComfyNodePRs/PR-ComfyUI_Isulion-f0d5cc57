The `mega_prompt_V3.py` file is designed to generate creative prompts based on various themes and parameters. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

### Imports and Initialization
1. **Imports**: The file imports several modules, including `random`, `os`, and various theme handler classes. These handlers are responsible for generating specific themed content.
2. **Class Definition**: The main class in this file is `MegaPromptV3`. It initializes a configuration manager and theme handlers.

### Class `MegaPromptV3`
- **Initialization (`__init__`)**: 
  - Initializes a `ConfigManager` to manage configurations.
  - Calls `_init_theme_handlers()` to set up the theme handlers.
  - Sets up a dictionary `theme_mappings` to map user-friendly theme names to internal identifiers.

- **Theme Handlers (`_init_theme_handlers`)**:
  - This method initializes a dictionary of theme handlers. Each handler corresponds to a specific theme and is initialized with the `ConfigManager`.
  - Handlers are responsible for generating content related to their theme.

- **Input Types (`INPUT_TYPES`)**:
  - Defines the input parameters for the class, including required and optional inputs.
  - Required inputs include `theme`, `complexity`, `randomize`, and `debug_mode`.
  - Optional inputs include `seed`, `custom_subject`, `custom_location`, `include_environment`, `include_style`, and `include_effects`.

### Theme Handler Functionality

Theme handlers in the `MegaPromptV3` system are specialized classes that generate themed content based on configurations. Each theme handler inherits from the `BaseThemeHandler` class, which provides a common interface and utility methods for theme management.

#### Key Components of Theme Handlers:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Each theme handler is initialized with a `ConfigManager` instance, allowing it to access and utilize configuration data specific to its theme.
   - Handlers maintain a local configuration dictionary (`theme_config`) and a debug mode flag.

2. **Configuration Access**:
   - Handlers use the `ConfigManager` to retrieve configuration values, which dictate the elements and styles specific to the theme.
   - The `_get_random_choice()` method is employed to select random elements from the configuration, ensuring variability in generated content.

3. **Debugging Support**:
   - The `set_debug()` method allows enabling or disabling debug mode, which can be useful for development and troubleshooting.
   - The `debug_print()` method outputs debug information when debug mode is active, aiding in monitoring the handler's operations.

4. **Content Generation**:
   - Each handler implements its own logic to generate themed content, typically through a `generate()` method.
   - The generated content includes various components like subjects, environments, styles, and effects, depending on the theme.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Handlers are designed to manage errors internally, ensuring that any issues during content generation do not disrupt the overall process.

Theme handlers are crucial for the modularity and extensibility of the `MegaPromptV3` system, allowing for easy addition of new themes and customization of existing ones.

### Custom Subject and Custom Location

In the `MegaPromptV3` system, the parameters `custom_subject` and `custom_location` allow users to inject specific elements into the generated prompts, providing a higher degree of personalization and control over the output.
